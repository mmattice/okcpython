<p>
    This is the standard battleship game, where each client places their ships on a
    grid, and then fires at the opponent. You fire as many shots as you have surviving ships.
</p>

<p>
    You start the game with 5 ships, on a <code>10 x 10</code> grid.
</p>

<p>
    When the game starts, the server will inform you of your number of ships, the
    size of each ship, and the size of the grid you will be working on. The server
    will then request the placement of the ships.
</p>

<p>
    This is due to the server being written to allow different size boards and ships,
    but for this contest we will only be using a 10 x 10 with the ships listed below.
</p>

<p>
    The server supports ships that range in length from 1 to 10, but for the purposes of this contest,
    we will use the sizes used in the physical game.

    There is one ship that is 2 squares long,
    two ships 3 squares long, one ship 4 squares long, and one ship 5 squares long (2, 3, 3, 4, 5).
</p>

<p>
    The client will respond with a list of positions and orientations, which are
    given as <code><strong>x, y</strong></code> coordinates and a literal <code><strong>V</strong></code> or
    <code><strong>H</strong></code> for vertical or horizontal alignment.
    Vertically aligned ships are described by their top most grid location, and
    horizontally aligned ships are described by their left most grid location.
    The grid's top-left location is <code>(0, 0)</code>, and the bottom-right location is
    <code>(WIDTH-1, HEIGHT-1)</code>.
</p>

<p>
    So, for our 10 x 10 grid:

<p>
    Both players will have the same number of ships and the same size of ships.
</p>

<p>
    After all ships have been placed, the game begins.
</p>

<h3>Round</h3>

<p>
    Each player gets to make N shots per turn, where N is the number of ships that
    they have at the beginning of the turn. Once both players have announced all
    of their shots for the turn, the server will compute what damage might have
    been done and then report this information to each player.
</p>

<h3>End Game</h3>

<p>
    The game ends when one player has destroyed all of the other player's ships.
    It is possible that both players will destroy their opponent in the same turn,
    resulting in a tie.
</p>

<h3>Example Run</h3>

<p>
    Here is an example of all messages being sent back and forth for a short game on a smaller board with only 2 ships.
